Manual Instructions :

- In this, basically at lv-1 in the start one key blinks and user have to click on the same button which has blinked afterwards.
- Then on moving on lv -2 one more button is blinked but now user should click on the buttons exactly in same sequence in which they blinked i.e. Pattern : Button at lv1 , Button at lv2 ]
- There are total of 4 buttons which will blink at start of each level
- The pattenr that user have to recall gets incremented by one with each increasing level for eg : at lv x the pattern will be of x length.
- If at any point the pattern do not matches then the Gaem gets over
- User can restart by clicking any key.
- Thus it is a fun intellectual based game which aims at testing and challenging the individuals's memory retention capacity.
